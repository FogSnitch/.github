# Hello ðŸ‘‹

We build tools that help team's see the invisible.

Our tool monitors your cloud to know if it has gone down.

## Our stack

We mostly write Python. Our web stack is Django with classic server-rendered templates (for now), backed by Postgres and Redis. Infrastructure lives in Kubernetes and we manage it using Pulumi and Terraform. We deploy with GitHub Actions, and we believe in boring, battle-tested tools â€” unless there is a good reason not to be.

We are a small team, so you will have a big footprint. You will own features end-to-end and help shape our platform from the ground up.
