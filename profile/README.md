# FogSnitch ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to FogSnitch â€” we build tools that help team's see the invisible.

We are an infrastructure team solving problems in observability.

## What weâ€™re building

Our tool monitors your cloud to know if it has gone down.

## Our stack

We mostly write Python. Our web stack is Django with classic server-rendered templates (for now), backed by Postgres and Redis. Infra lives in Kubernetes and we manage it using Pulumi and Terraform. We deploy with GitHub Actions, and we believe in boring, battle-tested tools â€” unless there's a good reason not to be.

Weâ€™re a small team, so youâ€™ll have a big footprint. Youâ€™ll own features end-to-end and help shape our platform from the ground up.
